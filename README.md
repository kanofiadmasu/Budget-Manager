# Budget Manager

This is a command line app that can track your expesense, income and save them in a file. I built this app as a project to teach my self some of the theoretical concepts of python that I learned. This project taught me important python development concepts including, File I/O, Object Oriented Programming, Exception handling, control flow and conditonal statments. Since I am learning, none of the code in this project is produced or generated by AI, though I have used AI to understand some of the concepts that I didn't understand while building this project.

## Featres of the app  

   *.* Adding Transaction (Income/Expense)    
   *.* Showing history of transactions as a list  
   *.* Deleting specific Transactions using thier index  
   *.* Saving  and loading from a file
   

This is my first ever usefull python project. Prior to this I only built smaller projects to practice and learn specific concepts. As this is a beginner project this code can be refactored to produce more quality, readable, and efficeint code.
